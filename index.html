    <p class="intro">My dog is the coolest. She loves to play frisbee, tug-of-war, and fetching pretty much anything. 
        She enjoys finding socks, dryer sheets and any tissue. She's recently become a pro at chewing bones down to nothing. 
        She likes shredding boxes, barking at everything and nothing and waking you up by licking the inside of your ear.</p>
